# Bloodspear War

Ninety years ago, a decade after the Fall of [Nerath]({% link docs/nerath.md %}), a fierce horde of orcs known as the Bloodspear tribe descended from The Stonemarch and swept over the [Nentir Vale]({% link docs/nentir-vale.md %}). Fallcrestâ€™s army was defeated in a rash attempt to stop the Orcs out on Gardbury Downs. The Bloodspears burned and pillaged the Lowtown portion of Fallcrest and went on to wreak havoc all across the [Nentir Vale]({% link docs/nentir-vale.md %}).

Some say that the attack of the Bloodspears was the last act of the Yeenoghu-worshipping hordes that swept out of the west to cause the Fall of [Nerath]({% link docs/nerath.md %}), others say the tribe 
perceived the weakness of the [Nentir Vale]({% link docs/nentir-vale.md %}) after [Nerath's]({% link docs/nerath.md %}) fall and exploited it.
