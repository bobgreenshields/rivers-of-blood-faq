# Combat: Action declaration phase

A combat round is only 5 seconds.  Whilst acting, moving and reacting there is little time for making decisions based on what is simultaneously happening around you.

At the start of every round we will go around the table asking players what their characters will be doing that round.  We then resolve those actions in initiative order.

In the past I have allowed a limited amount of conditionality but not *I run over there and do that unless this happens in which case I run in the other direction and do something else.*

The conditionality usually revolves around changing your intended target because it has already being killed (as long as it doesn't involve extensive movement).  Although a little contradictory with the thinking behind this rule, having no one to attack and wasting a round is **not fun**.

It also helps to speed combat up, everyone thinks about what they are going to do at the same time rather than sequentially and if you are having problems I have a little sand timer to help focus your mind ðŸ˜€
