# Imbibing a potion

We will be sticking to the rules as written on this one i.e. taking a potion is a whole action.

I know that many groups (including Matt Mercer) house rule it to a bonus action but I think it's a big change to play and that this was a very conscious decision on the part of the designers.

In the midst of combat using an action to take a potion will often result in you taking as much damage as the potion heals with no balancing attack from you.  The intention here is that healing potions will most often be used in between combats when there is uncertain opportunity for a long rest.
