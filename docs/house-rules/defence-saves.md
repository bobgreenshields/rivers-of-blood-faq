# Defence Saves

Often referred to as *Player facing combat*.

Rather than having the DM roll a monster's *to hit* against a character the player rolls to see if their character avoids being hit.

Numerically the same, the character's Defence Save becomes

```
22 - their AC
```

and the player has to roll their Defence Save plus the monster's Attack Modifier or better on a d20.  If they roll a 1 the monster's hit is a critical.

## Pros and cons

### Pros
* the players are more involved, rolling more dice
* not any slower
* can't fudge

### Cons
* can't fudge
* I think Colin likes to roll for monsters
* players might construe a hit as *their failure* rather than *the DM's good luck*

I'm very open to discussion about this mechanic with everyone.  If the DM rolling is part of Col's fun we should definitely take that into consideration.
