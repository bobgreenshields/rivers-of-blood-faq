# Dump Stats Cha & Int

I thought I should mention this just in case.

I do understand that in many games of 5E some stats, especially Charisma and Intelligence, don't get used very much for checks and saves and this encourages people to use them as dump stats.  Obviously some classes require high levels in these characteristics and players that choose these classes typically do not get the same use out of their prime characteristics that Strength and Wisdom focussed classes do.

I consciously try to address this balance and, for example, make extensive use of investigation checks rather than perception checks whenever it might be appropriate.  I also like to use Charisma to represent "force of personality" and so please expect more Charisma saves and checks than you might usually get.  I do understand that this overlaps with Wisdom to some extent and whilst I **will not** change the saves of any listed spells there may be various effects that require a Charisma save to avoid your personality being overcome.
