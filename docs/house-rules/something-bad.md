# Something Bad is Going to Happen

This one is totally meta.

It's taken me years to realise that D&D (or whatever you call it) is a game, certainly not a simulation, and that it's OK to break the fourth wall if it adds to the fun.

Often as encounters begin I will say

*Something bad is going to happen in 1d4 rounds.*

*Who wants to roll a d4?*

Perhaps the characters have a (remarkably accurate) sense of impending dread?  But anyway it adds to the tension that very soon things are going to get worse so the party needs to set to.

I also get the players to roll dice for spawning monsters.  Typically it's the ones rolled on a handful of dice and it's led to cheers of

*Hooray, we don't roll ones!*

So please be ready that we may use meta tricks to try and ramp up the tension.
