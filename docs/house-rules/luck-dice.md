# Luck Dice

Whenever a character fails a skill check in a stressful situation the player gets given a *Luck die*, a d6.

The player can then choose to add this to one of their rolls in the future.  They get to choose whether to roll a luck die **after** their roll has been made and, if they have more than one luck die, can choose to then roll additional luck dice.

A luck die roll can be added to
- skill / ability checks
- saves
- attack rolls
- damage rolls
- can be subtracted from damage taken by a character

The one exception that we play at the moment is that it cannot be used by a character to avoid being hit by an adversary i.e. deducted from their attack role or added to your [defence save]({% link docs/house-rules/defence-saves.md %}) (if we play that way).

This is more historical than anything else and I'm open to a discussion about it, especially if we use [defence saves]({% link docs/house-rules/defence-saves.md %}) rather than the DM rolling monster attacks.
