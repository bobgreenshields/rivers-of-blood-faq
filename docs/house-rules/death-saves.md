# Death Saves

These are work as per normal 5e but the player rolls them over the DM's screen and no one in the party gets to know the result.

I think that it's really hard not to metagame if you know the result of the death saves.  In fact it may not even be metagaming to change your actions if you know that a character is on the road to stabilising.

However I think it is hard to say that in the middle of combat that it would be easy to tell just by looking at a badly wounded comrade as to whether their bleeding was slowing, breathing stabilising etc. And... it makes the game more exciting, everyone starts getting tense after the first two saves.
