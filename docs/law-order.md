# Law and Order

The isolated islands of civilisation in the wilderness rely on the anchor of order to prevent them from being swept away by the myriad of forces arrayed against them.

There is no appetite for the costs associated with imprisonment and rehabilitation, practicality is an important factor in the punishment of crimes.  Stocks, gibbets, floggings, hangings and [wergild](#wergild) are all common methods of swiftly punishing offenders and resolving an injury.

Judgement maybe spontaneous, summary and possibly corrupt but order must be maintained.  Bandits may demand payment from travellers and raid farms but cause too much damage and disruption or, heaven forbid, steal from the wrong person and a force will be raised to hunt them down.  A swift death being the best that they can hope for at that point.

Placing a bounty on a fugitives head is a common practice especially for those who commit crimes and are tried in their absence.

Villains who travel the countryside robbing and killing will find themselves visited upon by lynch mobs within towns and unscrupulous bounty hunters without.

### Wergild

Compensation paid by a person committing an offense to the injured party or, in the case of death, to his family. In certain instances part of the wergild is paid to the king and to the lord - these having lost, respectively, a subject and a vassal.
