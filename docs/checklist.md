# Pre game checklist

We are now only a couple of weeks away from the game and I'd like to finalise your characters so that I can prepare tokens and cards to make running them easier for you.

This will take me a little while so I'd be very grateful if you could do this as soon as you can please.


## Finish your character
- give them a name
- choose equipment
- choose the spells that you are most likely to be using
- if you are a spellcaster and using a focus let me know what it is and how you use it
- let me know if you have any feats or other features

## Fill in a character sheet

When you have finished your character please download a fillable pdf [character sheet]({% link assets/DD-character-sheet-5e-fillable.pdf %}) and complete it with equipment and especially your choice of spells if you are a caster.

I'll print a copy out for you before you arrive.

## Choose some artwork for your character

I'll use this to make a token for you and for your card on the initiative tracker.

A high resolution picture will come out much better than something that is only 50x80 and my experience is that a light, bright image will be better when printed but I'm very happy to give whatever you choose a go and we can see how it comes out.

## Upload your files

I've pinned a Discord message in the updates channel that contains a link to a Dropbox upload.  Please use this to send me your sheets and artwork.
