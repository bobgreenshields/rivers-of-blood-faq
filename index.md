I'm going to add more and more here over the coming days so that you have a single place to go for your information for you to refer to later.

I thought it would be better than having to scroll back through discord posts.

I don't know if any of you have seen The RPG Social Contract video before but it's easy viewing and I'd appreciate it if you could watch it.  Comments are very welcome obviously.
